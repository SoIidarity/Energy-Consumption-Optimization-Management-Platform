# Energy-Consumption-Optimization-Management-Platform

This repository contains all source code for the witsecop.co.za website used to compare and contrast different buildings energy consumption at wits.

## Project Overview

## Documentation Structure
Each directory within the reposotry has its own `README.md` file to explain what the source code in that particular directory does. Moreover, how to run that particular section of code is explained. All code assume the user has installed the requirements for that particular component.

## Repository Structure
There are four main directories in the repository.
1) `Assets` that store the information for each building, such as chart geojson information and other relevant charting information. Campus information data structures are also store here.
2) `Backbend` contains all backbend code , containers and notebooks to run the API.
3) `Frontend` contains all front end code, containers, components and elements to run the front end server.
